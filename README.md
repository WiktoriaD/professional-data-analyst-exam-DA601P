## About the project
This project is part of the Data Analyst Certification program. It focuses on analyzing the effectiveness of various sales methods (Email, Call, Email + Call) for Pens and Printers' new product line. The goal is to determine which methods generate the most revenue per customer and provide data-driven recommendations to optimize sales strategies.

At the end of the project, I presented my findings in a summary [presentation](https://github.com/WiktoriaD/professional-data-analyst-exam-DA601P/blob/main/Sales%20strategy%20analysis%20for%20products.pdf).
